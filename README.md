AtTiny85_Binaeruhr
==================

A nice low coast LED binary clock.

For the configuration of the RTC use this --> https://github.com/2tata/Arduino_RTC-Configurator

I use for the ATtiny85 8MHz internal clockspeed besause 1MHz will not worke but I donÂ´t know why.
If you have any question you can ask me.
